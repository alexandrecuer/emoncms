Once you have inputs you can either log them straight to feeds or if you want you can add various levels of input processing to your inputs to create things like daily average data or to calibrate inputs before storage. Alternatively you can create Virtual feeds, this is a special feed that allows you to do post processing on existing storage feeds data, the main advantage is that it will not use additional storage space and you may modify post processing list that gets applyed on old stored data.
